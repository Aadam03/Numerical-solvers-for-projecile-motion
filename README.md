# Numerical-solvers-for-projecile-motion
Utilising Eulers and Runge Kutta ODEs to model a ball's motion when projected or dropped over angles. Drag and buoyancy considerations are included to make simulations more accurate. A model to show how the density of a material and fluid will affect the journey is also shown.
