# Numerical-solvers-for-projecile-motion
Utillising Eulers and Runge kutta ODE's to model a balls motion when projected or dropped over angles. Drag and buoyancy considerations included to make simulations more accurate. A model to show how the density of a material and fluid will affect the balls journey is also shown.
